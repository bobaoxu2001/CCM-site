    "In this notebook, you will implement (mostly from scratch!) a Bayesian concept learning model and the \"number game,\" as covered in lecture. As with so many of our everyday inferences, the data we receive is far too sparse and noisy to be conclusive. Nevertheless, people must make generalizations and take actions based on imperfect and insufficient data. In data science and machine learning, the situation is often the same: the data is not enough to produce an answer with certainty, yet we can make meaningful generalizations anyway. What computational mechanisms can support these types of inferences?\n",

    "The number game is a quintessential inductive problem. In the number game, there is an unknown computer program that generates numbers in the range 1 to 100. You are provided with a small set of random examples from this program. For instance, in the figure below, you get two random examples from the program: the numbers '8' and '2'.\n",

Perhaps, if the concept is \"all numbers up to 10.\" What about '10'? A better candidate, since the program could again be \"numbers up to 10\", or \"all even numbers.\" What about '16'? This is another good candidate, and the program \"powers of 2\" is also consistent with the examples so far. How should one generalize based on the evidence so far? This homework explores how the Bayesian framework provides an answer to this question."

    "### The Bayesian model\n",
    "In the number game, we receive a set of $n$ positive examples $X = \\{x^{(1)},...,x^{(n)}\\}$ of an unknown concept $C$. In a Bayesian analysis of the task, the goal is predict $P(y \\in C\\ |\\ X)$, which is the probability that a new number $y$ is also a member of the concept $C$ after receiving the set of examples $X$.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Updating beliefs with Bayes' rule\n",
    "Let's proceed with the Bayesian model of the task. There is a hypothesis space $H$ of concepts, where a particular member of the hypothesis space (i.e., a particular concept) is denoted $h \\in H$. The Bayesian model includes a prior distribution $P(h)$ over the hypotheses and a likelihood $P(X|h)$. Bayes' rule specifies how to compute the posterior distribution over hypotheses given these two pieces:\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "P(h|X) = \\frac{P(X|h)P(h)}{\\sum_{h' \\in H} P(X|h')P(h')}\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "The likelihood and prior are specified below.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Likelihood\n",
    "We assume that each number in $X$ is an independent sample from the set of all valid numbers. Thus, the likelihood decomposes as a product of individual probabilities,\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "P(X|h) = \\prod_{i=1}^n P(x^{(i)}|h).\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "We assume that the numbers are sampled uniformly at random from the set of valid numbers, such that $P(x^{(i)}|h) = \\frac{1}{|h|}$ if $x^{(i)} \\in h$ and $P(x^{(i)}|h) = 0$ otherwise. The term $|h|$ is the cardinality or set size of the hypothesis $h$.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Prior\n",
    "The hypothesis space $H$ includes two main kinds of hypotheses. You can think of each hypothesis as a list of the numbers that fit that hypothesis.\n",
    "- The first kind consists of mathematical hypotheses such as odd numbers, even numbers, square numbers, cube numbers, primes, multiples of $n$, powers of $n$, and numbers ending with a particular digit. Each mathematical hypothesis is given equal weight in the prior.\n",
    "- The second kind consists of interval hypotheses, which are solid intervals of numbers, such as $12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17$. Intervals of intermediate size are favored (rather than very small or large hypotheses) by reweighting according to an Erlang distribution, $P(h) \\propto \\frac{|h|}{\\sigma^2} \\exp{-|h|/\\sigma}$ such that $\\sigma=10$.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is a free parameters `mylambda` controls how much of the prior is specified by each type of hypothesis, with `mylambda` weight going to the mathematical hypotheses and `1-mylambda` weights going to the interval hypotheses.\n",
    "\n",
    "We provide starter code below that generates the mathematical hypotheses and their prior probabilities (in natural log space).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Making Bayesian predictions\n",
    "Once we have the posterior beliefs over hypotheses, we want to be able to make predictions about the membership of a new number $y$ in the concept $C$, or as mentioned $P(y \\in C\\ |\\ X)$. To compute this, we average over all possible hypotheses weighted by the posterior probability,\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "P(y \\in C\\ |\\ X) = \\sum_{h \\in H} P(y \\in C\\ |\\ h) P(h|X),\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "where the first term is simply $1$ or $0$ based on the membership of $y$ in h, and the second term is the posterior weight."

    "The Bayesian model for the number game serves as a compelling representation of how humans might process information and make inferences based on limited data. The model’s core—balancing the likelihood of new information against prior beliefs and knowledge—is a principle that resonates with general human cognitive processes. In the constrained environment of the number game, the model demonstrates a high degree of fidelity in predicting human behavior, capturing our tendency to seek patterns and rationalize them within our existing mental frameworks. However, the model's convincing nature within the game's confines doesn't necessarily translate seamlessly to more complex real-world learning scenarios. In reality, humans deal with a vast array of stimuli and draw from a richer set of experiences and cognitive biases, which the model in its current form may not fully encompass.\n",
    "\n",
    "In more naturalistic settings such as childhood concept learning, the Bayesian model still holds relevance as it mimics the way children refine their understanding of the world through iterative observations and feedback. The hypothesis space in such scenarios could be informed by a combination of innate cognitive predispositions and accumulated knowledge through social and environmental interactions. Yet, the challenge lies in the model's ability to account for the depth and variability of human learning experiences. The processes that humans might use to approximate Bayesian inference likely involve heuristics that prioritize certain hypotheses over others based on their plausibility and cognitive availability. These mental shortcuts enable efficient and practical decision-making without the computational overhead of considering every possible hypothesis. It's plausible that humans employ adaptive strategies that focus on the most promising hypotheses while discarding less likely ones, akin to algorithms used in machine learning, such as Markov Chain Monte Carlo or other sampling techniques that provide robust approximations without exhaustive enumeration."
